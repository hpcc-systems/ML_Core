/**
  * Assign sequence numbers within groups for a dataset.
  * Given a file (dataset) which is sorted by the work item identifier and
  * INFIELD (and possibly other values), add sequence numbers within
  * the range of each infield.
  * Slighly elaborate code is to avoid having to partition the data
  * to one value of infield per node and to work with very large
  * numbers of records where a global count project would be
  * inappropriate.
  * This is useful for assigning rank positions with the groupings.
  *@param infile the input file, any type.
  *@param infield field name of grouping field.
  *@param seq name of the field to receive the sequence number.
  *@param wi_name work item field name, default is wi.
  *@return a file of the same type with sequence numbers applied.
